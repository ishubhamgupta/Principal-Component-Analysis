**Principal Component Analysis**


Its an unsupervised statistical technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables in order 
to identify the underlying structure of those variables

It is also known sometimes as a general 'factor analysis'


Where regression determines a line of best fit to a dataset, factor analysis determines several orthogonal lines
of best fit to the data set

Orthogonal means 'at right angles'
 > Actually the lines are perpendicular to each other in n-dimensional space

n-Dimensional Space is the variable sample space
 > There are as many dimensions as there are variables so in a data set with 4 variables the sample space is 
   4-dimensional
  
If we use this technique on a data set with a large number of variables, we can compress the amount of explained 
variation to just a few components
The most challenging part of PCA is interpreting the components
